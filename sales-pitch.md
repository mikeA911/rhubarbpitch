📊 Knowledge Base Revenue Share
Every contribution you make to the knowledge base earns you points. When facilities pay to license that content, you get paid.
How It Works:
Step 1: Contribution Points System
Contribution
Points
Why
Major template (5+ pages)
5 points
Substantial, reusable content
Medium template (2-4 pages)
3 points
Useful specific resource
Small template (1 page)
2 points
Quick reference tool
Helpful answer/tip
1 point
Bite-sized knowledge

Step 2: Domain Licensing Revenue When a facility licenses a knowledge base domain (e.g., "FHIR Implementation" for $299/year), that revenue is split:
Platform: 60% ($179.40)
Content Creators: 30% ($89.70) ← This is split among contributors based on points
Curator: 10% ($29.90)
Step 3: Your Share Calculation Your share = (Your Points / Total Points in Domain) × 30% of licensing revenue

REAL EXAMPLE: FHIR Implementation Domain
You are Sarah, a FHIR consultant who joined 4 months ago:
Your Contributions:
Submitted comprehensive FHIR roadmap from your project (5 points)
Created vendor comparison matrix (3 points)
Shared data mapping checklist (2 points)
Answered 15 helpful forum questions (15 points)
Your Total: 25 points
Domain Status:
Total content in FHIR domain: 500 points (from all contributors)
Your contribution: 25/500 = 5% of domain content
Domain licensed by 50 facilities @ $299 = $14,950/year
Content creator pool: 30% of $14,950 = $4,485/year
Your Annual Revenue Share:
5% of $4,485 = $224/year (paid monthly: ~$19/month)
Plus your subscription credits:
$130 in credits over 3 months = $43/month savings
Total Benefit:
$19/month revenue share
$43/month credits
= $62/month benefit
If you're on Professional tier ($99/month):
Effective cost: $99 - $62 = $37/month 💰
63% discount from contributions alone!

As Your Contributions Grow:
After 12 months as active contributor:
You've contributed to 3 different domains (FHIR, VBC, Telehealth)
Your total points across domains: 150 points
Each domain licensed by 50-100 facilities
Your monthly KB revenue: $50-80/month
Your credits: $30-50/month
Total benefit: $80-130/month
On Professional tier ($99/month):

🎯 WHY THE CAREER PATH MATTERS
Traditional Consulting:
You're always just a contractor
No equity, no ownership
Income ceiling based on your hours
Build client relationships, not a platform
When you stop working, income stops
Rhubarb Career Path:
Start as contractor, become owner
Earn equity in growing platform
Income scales beyond your hours (KB licensing, advisory)
Build platform that attracts clients to you
Passive income + equity value compounds over time
You're not just working IN the business, you're building it WITH us

❓ FOUNDING MEMBER FAQ
Q: What if I can't commit 15-20 hours/month? A: Consider Tier 2 (10-15 hours) or Tier 3 (5-10 hours). We want quality over quantity.
Q: Can I lose my equity? A: Yes, if you don't fulfill responsibilities or leave before 1-year cliff. After that, you keep vested equity even if you leave.
Q: What if Rhubarb fails? A: Equity becomes worthless, but you've still earned advisory fees and project income along the way. Typical startup risk.
Q: Can I sell my equity? A: Not until an exit event (acquisition or IPO) or unless the company approves. You can't sell to external parties without approval.
Q: Do I have to curate content forever? A: Active curation required during vesting period (4 years). After that, you can reduce involvement but retain equity.
Q: What's the tax treatment? A: Equity is typically taxed as capital gains when sold (not income). Consult your tax advisor. We use standard ISOs (Incentive Stock Options).
